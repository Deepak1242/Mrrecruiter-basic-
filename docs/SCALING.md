# Scaling Strategy

## Current State
- Frontend: React SPA hosted on Netlify
- Backend: Node.js serverless functions on Vercel
- Database: Mock in-memory (development only)
- Users: ~100 concurrent users max

## Immediate Scaling Needs (0-1000 users)

### Database
- Migrate from mock to MongoDB Atlas
- Add basic indexes (email, username)
- Connection pooling

### Performance
- Add Redis caching for frequent queries
- Optimize database queries
- Compress API responses
- CDN for static assets

### Monitoring
- Basic error logging
- Performance monitoring
- Uptime monitoring

## Medium Scale (1000-10000 users)

### Infrastructure
- Load balancing
- Database replica sets
- Separate staging environment

### Performance
- Advanced caching strategies
- Database query optimization
- Image optimization and CDN
- Code splitting and lazy loading

### Features
- Search functionality (Elasticsearch)
- File uploads (cloud storage)
- Email service integration

## Large Scale (10000+ users)

### Architecture
- Microservices for different features
- Message queues for async processing
- Auto-scaling infrastructure

### Database
- Database sharding
- Read replicas
- Data archiving strategies

### Advanced Features
- Real-time features (WebSockets)
- Advanced search and recommendations
- Analytics and reporting

## Cost Considerations
- Start with managed services (MongoDB Atlas, Redis Cloud)
- Use serverless where possible to reduce costs
- Monitor and optimize resource usage
- Consider reserved instances for predictable workloads

## Key Metrics to Monitor
- Response times
- Database query performance
- Error rates
- User engagement
- System resource usage

## Scaling Timeline
1. **Month 1-2**: Database migration and basic caching
2. **Month 3-6**: Performance optimizations and monitoring
3. **Month 6-12**: Advanced features and infrastructure scaling
4. **Year 2+**: Microservices and advanced scaling patterns
