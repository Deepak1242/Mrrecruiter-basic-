# Security Measures

## Authentication
- JWT tokens for user sessions
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Stored in HTTP-only cookies (secure)
- Backup authorization header support

## Password Security
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- Salt rounds: 10 (industry standard)
- Minimum 6 characters required
- Never returned in API responses

## Input Validation
- All user inputs validated on backend
- Email format validation
- Username length requirements
- SQL injection prevention


## CORS Configuration
- Only allowed origins can access API
- Development: localhost:5173
- Production: mrinterviewer.netlify.app
- Credentials enabled for cookies

## HTTPS Enforcement
- All production traffic uses HTTPS
- Secure cookie flags in production
- Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirects

## Data Protection
- User passwords never stored in plain text
- Sensitive data excluded from logs
- Database queries use parameterized statements
- User data access restricted to authenticated users

## Future Security Enhancements
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Two-factor authentication
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Regular security updates
- Penetration testing

## Security Best Practices
- Regular dependency updates
- Environment variables for secrets
- Separate development/production configs
- Minimal data exposure in APIs
- Regular backup and recovery testing
